# The Hub Helper

The Hub Helper is a modern, easy-to-use GUI application designed to streamline and automate data entry tasks. Developed with user experience in mind, it allows for quick copy-pasting of individual fields as well as entire forms. The Hub Helper can save time and increase productivity by automating routine tasks.

## Features

- Clean, modern user interface.
- Ability to easily copy and paste individual fields or entire forms.
- Verification option to confirm information.
- Direct links to useful web resources.
- Capability to clear individual fields or all fields at once.
- Search functionality integrated directly into the application.

## Installation

You can run The Hub Helper directly on your machine using the provided executable located in the repository.

Alternatively, if you want to run the Python script, you will need the following dependencies installed:

- PyQt5
- pyperclip

To install these dependencies, you can use pip:

    pip install PyQt5 pyperclip

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the script like any other Python script:

    python app.py

## Usage

Start the application and use the intuitive interface to interact with the form fields. Each field comes with a copy button for easy copying of individual fields. The fields can also be cleared individually using the 'Clear' buttons. There is also a 'Clear All' button to clear all fields at once.

The 'MFA' and 'Password Reset' buttons allow you to copy the whole form as a formatted string, which can be pasted directly into your target location.

For convenience, the application provides a 'Paste' button to populate the fields with data from your clipboard. This is particularly useful when dealing with pre-formatted data.

In addition, the application provides direct links to relevant web resources through the 'Find by ID' and 'Find by Phone' buttons.

## Executable File

An executable file for Windows is available for download [here](https://github.com/Khalefa-H/Hub_helper/blob/main/dist/gui.exe). Simply download and run the executable to use The Hub Helper without needing to install any dependencies or Python.
